# Data_Wrangling_API_Project



# Learning Objective

- Practice new data wrangling techniques with using API.
- Get accustomed to JSON files and Python json modules.
- Practice list comprehensions.


# Description

For this mini project, we will focus on equities data from the Frankfurt Stock Exhange from [Quandl API](https://www.quandl.com/). I will try and analyze the stock prices for the year of 2017 of a company called Carl Zeiss Meditec, which manufactures tools for eye examinations, as well as medical lasers for laser eye surgery. 


# Notes

- Python [`requests` module](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/) used for connecting the Quandl API and getting the data from there. 
- Pyhton data structure [documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html)
